# Logic-based-Agent  
In this project, we are aiming to implement a simplified logic-based version
of the Coast Guard agent. This agent reasons using the situation calculus. The
project will be implemented in Prolog. In this grid, there is only one station,
exactly two ships, each of them has exactly one passenger who does not expire
with time. There are no black boxes to retrieve. The agent’s capacity can be
either 1 or 2. The grid size is 3 × 3 or 4 × 4.
